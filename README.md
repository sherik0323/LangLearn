I think it is the best app in SwiftUI. Unfortunetly there is one problemðŸ˜… which i have not fixed. I will tell you later. Firstly when u open the the app there are three tabs. First tab - Here you can write word, its translation and description. Also on the top there is searchfield where you can find the word which you have wrote past. Second tab - here you can see translation of word which u write on first tab, but there is one problem, it does not show the words why i do not know but i am trying to fix it.
